predicting the future prices of stock using the tweets

Stock market has been a subject of research over past few years and in this project we have tried to calculate the future prices of stock by perfoming sentimental analysis on twitter data
The dataset used is "tweets about top companies from year 2015 to 2020" from Kaggle
The dataset has tweets for five companies naming Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla and Apple.
To simplify and predict the prices individually I have separated out the data for each company 
This project calculates the value of stock price of TESLA and calculated the accuracy of different models for which I have collected the historical data of stock prices from yahoo.finance
